In this lesson we've learned about using the debugger built in to Node.js. To review, the process is as follows:

- Place one or more breakpoints in your code using the debugger keyword
- Run node inspect <filename> in the terminal to launch the debugger
- Run cont at the debug prompt to start execution of the code and advance to the first breakpoint
- Run repl at the debug prompt to enter the debugger's REPL
- Check the value of any variables by entering the variable name at the > prompt
- Exit the REPL using ctrl-C
- Continue stepping through the code using cont
- Run .exit or type ctrl-C twice to exit the debugger
